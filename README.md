# Planar Mechanism Analysis and Simulation

This is a project related to the **Dynamics of Machines** course, where students are given a diagram image and are required to analyze the diagram in MATLAB. This project presents a complete **kinematic and dynamic analysis** of a planar multi-link mechanism using MATLAB. It includes **animated motion simulation**, **position and velocity analysis**, and the calculation of **input torque** using **numerical methods**.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the project folder using the `cd` command or through the file browser.
3. Run the following scripts:
   - **Kinematic analysis and plots**:
     ```matlab
     kinematic_analysis
     ```

   - **Dynamic force analysis**:
     ```matlab
     dynamic_analysis
     ```

## üìä Output

- **Plots** of:
  - Angular velocities and accelerations of different links
  - Linear velocities and accelerations of points in the mechanism
  - Required input torque for motion
- **Real-time animation** of the mechanism's motion using MATLAB‚Äôs built-in plotting functions.

---

## üìå Notes

- The mechanism is driven by a crank rotating at a **constant angular velocity (œâ‚ÇÇ = 42 rad/s)**.
- Trigonometric constraints are handled with MATLAB's built-in functions to ensure accurate results.
- **Force analysis** uses **nonlinear systems** solved by the `fsolve` function in MATLAB.
- If you're experiencing errors with `fsolve`, make sure that the system is properly initialized with reasonable starting values.
